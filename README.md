# Building Neural Network Using NumPy

This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network from scratch using **NumPy**, without relying on deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Project Goals
- Understand the internal mechanics of neural networks
- Implement forward propagation and backpropagation manually
- Train a neural network using gradient descent
- Gain practical experience with NumPy-based numerical computation

## Features
- Fully connected (dense) neural network
- Forward pass implementation
- weight updates
- Loss computation
- Training loop from scratch

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy

## Educational Purpose
This project is designed for **academic and learning purposes**, helping students understand how neural networks work internally before using high-level libraries.
